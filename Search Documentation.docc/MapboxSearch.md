# ``MapboxSearch``

Start using location search powered by Mapbox easily.

## Overview


The Mapbox Search SDK is a developer toolkit to add location search on mobile devices.
With the same speed and scale of the Mapbox Search API, the SDK is built specifically for on-demand and local search use cases, like ride-share, food delivery, and store finders apps.
Whether your users are trying to find a place among the vast amount of data on a global map, or to find the exact location of a venue a few miles down the road, the Search SDK provides location search for countries all over the globe, in many different languages.

Previously, implementing search into your application required custom tuning with every API request to set a language, location biasing, and result types.
There was no pre-built UI and no option for a user to see their search history, or save favorites.

The Mapbox Search SDK allows you to drop pre-tuned search into your application, removing the complexity of API configuration, while still giving you control to customize.
It ships with an optional UI framework, or you can build a completely custom implementation with your own UI elements by using the core library.
The Search SDK is pre-configured for autocomplete, local search biasing, and includes new features like category search, search history, and search favorites.
